Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding valid subdomains for a domain.

Use https://crt.sh to check the certificate records.

Use this to filter search that would contain only the all the subdomains (as indicated by the wildcard) but excludes the main domain (as indicated by the dash-). This is best to use when we are trying to find the subdomains of an organizition. 

## TASK 4: DNS Bruteforce

Use dnsrecon -t brt -d <em>domainName</em> tp find the subdomains quickly.

<ul>
  <li><strong>-t brt:</strong> This indicates the type of recon which is bruteforce.</li>  
  <li><strong>-d domainName:</strong> Specifies the domain to recon</li>
</ul>

## TASK 5: OSINT-Sublist3r

To automate the DNS bruteforce above, use sublist3r. 
<ul>
  <li><strong>-d domainName:</strong> To input the domain name</li>
</ul>

## Task 6: Virtual Host
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://MACHINE_IP
Some domains are not publicly hosted. However, some webservers can host multiple websites in one server. The client asks the webserver and the server knows which ones to load. Thus, edit the host header to check for info.
