## Details

A phishing email was sent. It states that the user was flag as a spam sender.
<br>
# Analysis
Multiple methods were used to analyze the email. <br>
To avoid disclosing internal tooling and infrastructure, xxxx.com is used as a placeholder for the sender domain. The term “claimed domain” refers to the domain that the sender attempts to spoof or impersonate during the email authentication analysis.

## Email Body
Punctuation error. The error of using a comma instead of a period after the 'review' shows lack of professional checking.

## Email sender

The email sender lacks SPF, DKIM, DMARC. This means that it is not authoride by the claimed domain to send emails and it does not have the claimed domain related signature. More importantly, it is registered under 
HOSTINGER. It ia a legitimate domain selling site. Thus, the threat actor is leveraging the 'for sale' domains to bypass security checkers.

However, upon analyzing the code of the website, even if the user typed the the correct username and password, it will redirect the user to 'incorrect information page'. In this way,  the user types again. This is that the web can be sure that the stilen credential is correct.  


## Conclusion
As a precaution, do not click any links or download attachments. As always, do not click any links or download attachments. As always, forward the message to the SOC for analysis and then delete the email from both your inbox and trash. To check your account status, always navigate directly to the official portal via your browser rather than using links in an email. Stay alert for similar "urgent" security notices, and if you've already entered your credentials, change your password immediately.
